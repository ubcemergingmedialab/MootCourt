        "The trial judge found that the store employee closed the door to the office and stood with his back to it. Can you explain me to why you say that didn’t prevent the Respondent and his children from leaving?",

        "Can you please tell me where you are in your factum?",
        "The evidence was that the store employee didn’t intervene to avoid the problem when he saw that some of the grocery items hadn’t been scanned. In light of that, I am troubled by finding the employee’s conduct justified under s. 494(1). What do you have to say about that?",

    "RQuestions": [
        "Can you remind me what the trial judge’s findings were regarding who pushed the shopping cart into the office near the Store exit?",
        "Doesn’t the fact that the Respondent and his children ultimately left the store on their own demonstrate that he always had that option open to him?",
        "If the Respondent was on his way out of the store with goods he hadn’t paid for, wasn’t he in the process of committing an offence?",
        "The trial judge concluded that s. 494(1)(b) did not apply. Can you tell us why you do or don’t agree with that conclusion?",
        "Couldn’t the Respondent have avoided the whole situation if he produced his receipt when he was first asked to do so?"
